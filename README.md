Python Challenge
This challenge if for practice some PythonÂ´s script. 
You can see 2 folders because is about a two different problematic and also different solution-


About  PyPank this consist to read a csv file that reflect the budget of some period time, the solution is a Financial Analysis about the total of months, the  total amount, and a average between of the difference of each month during all the period, resolving that we get the greatest increase profits and also the greates decrease profit, we get the amount and the months that this happened.

For the program as an entry we have the resource a csv file, we have to read from some destination, running the main.py we get the outfile that in this case is a txt file in the folder analysis called Financial Analysis, also at the end of running in the screen we can see the result.

About PyPoll one we have the entry of data we have to resolve a Election Votes with  the total of votes of a list of candidates,first it summarize the total of votes for all the candidates, then obtain the total of votes of each candidate and the name, present the percentage of each candidate with they name  and with this information have the winner of the elections.

For the program first to solve is read the csv file from the path, summarize all the rows for each candidate and obtain the percentage, then I do a dictionary to with the both lists (name candidate and total votes) sort the greatest votes and get the name of the winner and generate a out file in txt format in the respective folder called analysis with all the results of the elections and in screen after running the same results will be presented.


**For both solutions the program to run is called main.py
